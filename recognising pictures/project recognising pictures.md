	This project consists of downloading the images from CIFAR and identifying the images based on classes. The network consists of 3 fully connected neural network and 2 convolutional layers. The number of filters and filter size are based on input size which is 32 x 32. The filter size is 3 and the filters used are 256. I am using adam optimizer for optimizing the network. The network uses crossentropy and relu for activation function. Matplotlib is used to plot the graph. The accuracy is tested using test images. 
The libraries used in this program are torch, torch.vision, matplotlib, numpy, torch.nn , torch .optim.
